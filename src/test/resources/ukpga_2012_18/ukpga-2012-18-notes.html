                        of enabling them to make medical recommendations about admitting mentally disordered

                        protection of the public under the Mental Health Act 1983.  That issue applied in
                        four regions (North East, Yorkshire and Humber, West Midlands and East Midlands).</p>

                     <p>The purpose of the Mental Health (Approval Functions) Act 2012 is to give retrospective
                        validation to the power to approve practitioners or clinicians under the Mental Health
                        Act 1983 and hence ensure the lawfulness of any detention or other action which was
                        taken on the basis that a valid power to approve existed.</p>

                     <p>The Mental Health Act 1983 makes provision for applications to be made for the admission
                        to and detention in a hospital of those who are suffering from mental disorder where
                        it is for their own health or safety or for the protection of others.  The purpose
                        of such admission and detention is to enable the individual concerned to be assessed
                        or treated in an appropriate environment.  In order for a person to be detained in
                        hospital for assessment or treatment, an application must be made to the managers
                        of the hospital in question and supported by written recommendations from two doctors
                        (one of whom must be an approved practitioner or an approved clinician) who have personally
                        examined the patient, along with an approved mental health professional (usually a
                        social worker). Similar requirements apply in other contexts, for example to support
                        the powers of the courts or the Secretary of State to order hospital admission or
                        to transfer to hospital persons serving sentences of imprisonment. Approved clinicians
                        are also in charge of patients’ treatment once they have been admitted to hospital
                        and are responsible for making a number of other decisions in relation to patients
                        under the Mental Health Act.</p>

                        functions to trusts providing mental health services. This meant that these trusts
                        granted approvals but had no legal power to do so.  The SHAs have recently rectified

                        trust) retrospective power under the Mental Health Act 1983 to approve a registered
                        medical practitioner for the purposes of section 12 and to approve a clinician under
                        section 145, where the approval was given before the Mental Health (Approval Functions)
                        Act 2012 obtained Royal Assent. This means that bodies to which an <abbr title="Strategic Health Authority">SHA</abbr> had no power to delegate these approval functions will be treated as if they had
                        always had the power to give approvals for the purposes of section 12 and to approve
                        persons as approved clinicians under section 145.  The Act only has effect in relation
                        to any approval given before Royal Assent (and so does not affect what SHAs or any
                        other bodies can do in the future).</p>

                        approvals to which section 1 relates were given in cases involving patients in England
                        or Wales, it is possible that a patient detained in England or Wales might be transferred
                        to Scotland or Northern Ireland for detention there. By providing that the retrospective
                        validation extends to Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Act removes any doubt about
                        the validity of the detention in Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>
